Smart Phone Sentiment Analysis (iPhone and Samsung Galaxy)
Client: Helio

Background 
We are working with a government health agency to create a suite of smartphone medical apps for aid workers in developing countries. This suite of apps will enable the aid workers to manage local health conditions by facilitating communication with medical professionals located elsewhere. The government agency requires that the app suite be bundled with one model of a smartphone. This will help them limit purchase costs and ensure uniformity when training helps workers use the device.

Objective 
We were given a shortlist of devices capable of executing the app suite’s functions, and we were asked to examine the prevalence of positive and negative attitudes toward these devices on the web. Our goal is to narrow this list down to one device by conducting a broad-based web sentiment analysis to gain insight into the attitudes about the devices. For the second part of the project, we will investigate predictive models using machine learning methods. We will apply these models to the Large Matrix file to complete the analysis of overall sentiment toward both iPhone and Samsung Galaxy.
